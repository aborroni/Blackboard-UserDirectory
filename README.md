# Blackboard-UserDirectory
Building Block for Blackboard Learn 
Uses information from Blackboard and combines it with user images stored outside of Blackboard.
The user image process is moderated by the computing staff
The display for faculty is different than the display for students or staff (institutional roles in Bb)
Faculty see current student schedule as well as other information. 
Students and Staff only see photo, email addrdess and name
We currently use the 'preferred' name that is found in BANNER as the user's first name in Blackboard
